# Yarizz's Dashboard

A personal life dashboard with a 90-day **Winter Arc** season on top. One place to see and log health, workouts, body, tasks, goals and money, built to keep growing: new areas of life are added as data, not new code.

**Live demo (fake data, no login):** https://winter-arc-dashboard-drab.vercel.app/demo

It's also a portfolio project. I'm a vibe coder: I planned, designed, directed and reviewed; [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) wrote the code. The whole process is logged in [`docs/BUILD_LOG.md`](docs/BUILD_LOG.md).

## What it does

- **Daily check-in in under 60 seconds** on a phone: steppers, switches and 1–5 scales for every tracker, one "Done" button.
- **Winter Arc season:** day X of 90, current and best streak, % of days with every target hit, and a 90-cell strip of the season.
- **Workouts and body:** log sets in seconds with "Repeat last workout", see lift progress and a weekly weight chart against a goal.
- **Tasks and goals:** a Board (To do / In progress / Waiting / Done), due-today and overdue tiles, goals linked to trackers.
- **Shareable progress card** (`/progress`): a portrait card made for a phone screenshot, plus a private link for an accountability group.
- **Money** (in progress): read-only from an existing Google Sheet, shown as a wallet stack.
- **Demo mode:** `/demo` runs the whole app on made-up data, so anyone can click around.

## Screenshots

| Daily check-in sheet | [`/demo/log`](https://winter-arc-dashboard-drab.vercel.app/demo/log) on a phone |
| Workout logger with "Repeat last workout" | [`/demo/log/workout`](https://winter-arc-dashboard-drab.vercel.app/demo/log/workout) |
| Shareable Winter Arc card | [`/demo/progress`](https://winter-arc-dashboard-drab.vercel.app/demo/progress) on a phone |

## Stack

| Part | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| App | Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript | A web app that works well on a phone |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Every colour and font is a token in one file |
| Database + login | Supabase (Postgres + Auth) | Real database, email sign-in, row-level security |
| Hosting | Vercel (Mumbai region) | Auto-deploys from GitHub, runs next to the database |
| Money data | Google Sheets (read-only) | Money already lives in a finance sheet |

The look is "Teal and grey": a grey frame, white cards and one dark teal hero card, with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for behaviour (44px touch targets, visible focus, reduced motion respected). Full spec in [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md).

## How it grows

The app is built from a few generic pieces, so a new area of life is a new row, not a new feature:

- **Tracker:** anything measured over time. Name, area (Health, Body, Mind, Skills, Money, Custom), type (`checkbox`, `number`, `scale_1_5`, `duration_minutes`), optional unit and a daily or weekly target. Adding one in `/settings` puts it in the check-in, the stats and the season straight away.
- **Entry:** one value for one tracker on one date.
- **Season:** a time-boxed challenge (Winter Arc = 90 days) with a start date and per-tracker targets.
- **Tile registry:** every Overview tile is one line in [`src/modules/registry.ts`](src/modules/registry.ts). A new module is a folder in `src/modules/` plus one entry there.

Workouts, tasks, goals and money have their own tables because their shape is different, but they plug into the same registry. `/demo` and the real dashboard share one data shape ([`src/modules/types.ts`](src/modules/types.ts)), so every tile works on both.

## Privacy

The repo is public; the data isn't. Real data lives only in Supabase, locked to one account by row-level security, and only one email can sign in. A pre-commit check ([`scripts/privacy-check.mjs`](scripts/privacy-check.mjs)) blocks commits that look like they contain personal details. The share card is public only through a secret token in its link and shows nothing beyond its six numbers.

## How I built it with AI

Every session followed the same loop: one phase per session, a short prompt from me, Claude Code builds and checks it in a real browser, then logs what happened. A few things that stood out:

- **Design first, in chat.** Four design passes on a canvas before any code (editorial → Apple HIG → light "Winter dawn" → a card layout inspired by my Obsidian theme), then the current "Teal and grey" look (v6) once the app was real. The spec lives in `docs/DESIGN.md` and the code follows its changelog.
- **Fake data first.** Phase 1 built the whole dashboard on made-up data at `/demo`. Every later phase swapped real data into the same tiles, so the demo never broke.
- **A privacy scare, caught early.** Before the first push, a check found real details in the design mockups (names, a card number, amounts). They were replaced before anything went public, and the pre-commit privacy check came out of it.
- **Bugs found by looking, not guessing.** A "Log Today" button had teal text on a teal background because a global link rule won; the weight chart's labels shrank too small on phones; a 30-per-row season strip turned into dots on a phone (now 15 per row).
- **Speed, from one response header.** The dashboard took 1–2 s after a check-in. Vercel's `x-vercel-id` header showed the server code running in the US while the database sat in Mumbai, so every read crossed the world. One line in `vercel.json` moved it to Mumbai.
- **Scope cuts are decisions too.** A Gmail inbox and an AI-assistant link were designed, then parked when simpler options looked better. Their code stays in the repo, hidden.

What I did myself: sign-ups, approving logins, and every product and design call. Claude Code wrote and tested the code; the full session-by-session story is in [`docs/BUILD_LOG.md`](docs/BUILD_LOG.md), and the phase plan in [`docs/BUILD_PLAN.md`](docs/BUILD_PLAN.md).

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # fill in the values you need
npm run dev
```

`/demo` works with no settings at all. The real dashboard needs a Supabase project (run the files in `supabase/migrations/` in order) and `ALLOWED_EMAIL`.
